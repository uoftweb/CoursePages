    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    Welcome to the course webpage for the Winter 2017 term of CSC108H, an
    Introduction to Computer Programming, on the St. George campus. This course
    teaches the basics of programming in Python, which is an
    industrial-strength programming language used at companies like Google and
    Industrial Light and Magic.
    </p>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    You will find most information about the course on this page, or linked to
    from this page. This website is required reading for the course. Course
    Announcements will be sent using Portal, and we expect that you will
    regularly check both Portal and your UofT email.
    </p>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    There are three lecture sections of this course with two different
    instructors: Tom and Paul. You are welcome to attend office hours with
    either of us.
    </p>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    Tom is the course coordinator, which means that he deals with all
    administrative matters: missed work, problems with your grades, problems
    with assignment partners, the course website, and TA issues. If you're not
    sure who to contact, though, feel free to ask either of us!
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2 black-80">On-campus vs. Online</h2>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    Two sections (L0101 and L5101) are on-campus and are delivered through 3
    lecture hours a week. For weeks 2 through 12, you will also watch video
    lectures to prepare for the on-campus lectures.
    </p>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    One section (L9901) is online and has additional online exercises in lieu
    of the on-campus lectures. You can find some advice here on choosing
    between the online section versus an on-campus section of CSC108.
    </p>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    Outside of class, all on-campus and online students will do weekly
    exercises, 3 assignments, a midterm test, and a final exam.
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2 black-80">Textbook</h2>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    The textbook, Practical Programming (2nd edition): An Introduction to
    Computer Science Using Python 3, matches very closely with the course
    material. Some notes:
    </p>
    <ul class="">
      <li class="mb2">
        <p class="lh-copy measure-wide">
        The first edition is out of date: it uses Python 2, not Python 3.
        Also, the material in the second edition is much, much closer to what
        we teach in this course.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="mb2">
        <p class="lh-copy measure-wide">
        You can purchase an eBook or a paper book. eBook ($25 USD): available in
        PDF, ePub, and mobi.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="mb2">
        <p class="lh-copy measure-wide">
        The book is also available from the UofT Bookstore and online retailers
        including amazon.ca.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ml4 lh-copy measure-wide">
    The textbook is optional, but we will post the sections of the book that
    are applicable each week on the Lectures page.
