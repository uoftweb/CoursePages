# Text

## Overview

The following will contain everything you need to know about the
text you will write, including:

  1. Headers
  2. Paragraph Text
  3. Links

## Headers

We recommend using a maximum of 4 depths for the header (`h1` through `h4`)
and no more. Any more than this may mean that the content needs to be restructured.
Too many sub-headlines may confuse your readers.

```html
<h1 class="f1">Largest Header</h1>
<h2 class="f2">Smaller</h2>
<h3 class="f3">Even Smaller</h3>
<h4 class="f3">Recommended Smallest</h4>
```
