## Usage

Download the starter pack here [TODO: LINK](#!). This will provide you with a directory that
contains an empty `index.html` page that references the CSS and JS you will see in this
documentation. The structure is as follows

```
index.html
static/
  css/
    main.css
  js/
    sidebar.js
    current-week.js
```

You can copy and paste any of the HTML and CSS provided and insert it into your
index.html page. We recommend the following layout for a complete site

```
index.html
sections/
  assignments/
    assignment1.html
    assignment2.html
    ...
  lectures/
    lecture1.pdf
    lecture2.pdf
    ...
  syllabus.html
  ...
static/
  css/
    main.css
  js/
    sidebar.js
    current-week.js
```

Make sure that all HTML files have link to `main.css`
