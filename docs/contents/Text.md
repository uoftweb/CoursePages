# Text

## Overview

The following will contain everything you need to know about the
text you will write, including:

  1. Headers
  2. Paragraph Text
  3. Links

## Headers

We recommend using a maximum of 4 depths for the header (`h1` through `h4`)
and no more. Any more than this may mean that the content needs to be restructured.
Too many sub-headlines may confuse your readers.

```html
<h1 class="f1">Largest Header</h1>
<h2 class="f2">Smaller</h2>
<h3 class="f3">Even Smaller</h3>
<h4 class="f3">Recommended Smallest</h4>
```

## Paragraph

Paragraph text should have _line height_ and _measure_. Line height is the
spacing between lines, while measure is how wide a line is. We recommend
1.5 line height and a wide measure to ensure easy readability.

```html
<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">Text goes here</p>
```

For large screen sizes, we recommend that it have a margin left of the screen
or sidebar, like so:

```html
<p class="ml5 measure-wide lh-copy">Text goes here</p>
```

## Links

Links should always be colored blue. Blue for links is historic, and
provides good contrast with white. The following is a snippet for links

```html
<a href="url goes here" class="link blue">Text</a>
```
