# Filter

A nice addition to the sidebar is a filter for the elements in it.
To use the filter:

  1. Link to the JavaScript file `filter.js` at the bottom of your homepage
     (and any page that uses a sidebar).
  2. Give the sidebar list (the `ul`) an `id` of `sidebar-search`

```html
<ul class="list f5" id="sidebar-search">
</ul>
```
